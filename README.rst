[![Build Status](https://quay.io/repository/littlemanco/kubectl/status "Build Status")](https://quay.io/repository/littlemanco/apache-php/)

-------------

Suprisingly, I can't find an up to date image with kubectl in it. So I'm creating one. 

I hope to be wrong, and find one in future.

Versioning Strategy

The Debian versioning strategy

Using these
-----------

Go nuts. However, I make no guarantees of their safety / security / usefulness. If you find issues, I'd love it if you
report them, but I can guarantee no timely fixes. Hopefully this stack will get picked up by someone willing to fork
out cash to support it, and I can chip away at improving it.
